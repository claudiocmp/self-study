    "### Parameter Estimation and Confidence Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, the purpose of a study is to estimate a parameter together with a 95% confidence interval (CI).\n",
    "A CI of an estimator, defines a possible range of values, that is believed the estimator can take (correctly).<br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "Given for 138 patients with osteporosis, the goal is to estimate the mean IGF-I serum level, with a 95% CI (*result: mean=300ng/mL with a 95% CI of [273,327]). <br/>Meaning: if we were to make an identical experiment, with the same number of patients, the mean will be captured 95% of the times in such interval.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hypothesis testing\n",
    "\n",
    "Assessment of two mutually excluding statements:\n",
    "* Null Hypothesis: the accepted state of the science\n",
    "* Alternative Hypothesis: the statement the researcher wants to demonstrate being sure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, We have two types of hypotheses:\n",
    "* 1-sided hypothesis:when we want to test that one treatment is better than another one.\n",
    "* 2-sided : when we want to test that two treatments are different\n",
    "\n",
    "|      | Null is true|Null is False|\n",
    "|----|----|----|\n",
    "|Fail to reject null hypothesis| Correct decision<br/>(True positive)| Type II error<br/>(False negative)|\n",
    "|Reject null| Type I error<br/>(False positive)|Correct decision<br/>(True negative)|\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance**: Probability of making a type-I error<br/>\n",
    "**Power**: probability of detecting departures from the null hypothesis (1 - probability of making a type-II error)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### P-Value and Significance\n",
    "\n",
    "**P-Value**\n",
    "The probability of seeing observed difference just by chance if the null-hypothesis is **true**. This gives how plausible the hypotheses you are evaluating are.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Significance Level**\n",
    "The predetermined significance level $\\alpha$ is the cut-off point that we compare our p-value to, so that we can make conclusion about the hypothesis. It refers to the possibility of make a Type-I error, and it is:\n",
    "* $\\alpha=5\\%$ for normal cases\n",
    "* $\\alpha=10\\%$ if the possibility of failing to reject the null hypothesis is more important for the test\n",
    "* $\\alpha=1\\%$ if the possibility of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis is more important for the test\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decision making: CI or P-value and Significance Level\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main methodologies that can be applied:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We use the CI\n",
    "When the hypothesised value is:\n",
    "* included in the CI, the null hypothesis is retained\n",
    "* **not** included in the CI, we have a statistically significan finding (reject null hypothesis)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### We Compare p-value to CI\n",
    "When the p-value is:\n",
    "* less than the pre-defined significan level, we have a statistically significant finding\n",
    "* $<5\\%$, is often accepted as a statistically significant. The threshold is arbitrary\n",
    "\n",
    "### Effect size\n",
    "\n",
    "The effect size is the measure of the intervention effect. It is used to put us into context, by relating the **type of data** and **goal of analysis**. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cohen's d\n",
    "\n",
    "We define Coehn's $d$ as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$d=\\frac{m_e - m_c}{s}$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "* $m_e$ is the mean of the experimental group\n",
    "* $m_c$ is the mean of the control group\n",
    "* $s$ is the pooled standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "$s = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n_1-1)s_1^2 + (n_2-1)s_2^2}{n_1+n_2-2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "and $s_1^2, s_2^2$ are the variance for each group, $n_1, n_2$ the group sizes\n",
    "\n",
    "Ref: [1](https://www.leeds.ac.uk/educol/documents/00002182.htm), [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effect_size#Cohen's_d)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "* Odd's ratios\n",
    "* Relative risk\n",
    "* R^2\n",
    "\n",
    "### Practical vs Statistical significance\n",
    "\n",
    "If something is statistically significant, it does not mean that such finding has a practical implementation (e.g. a change in marketing operations might increases the sales, but its costs increases at a point that such significance is lost).\n"

    "\n",
    "Example: I have misplaced my phone somewhere in the home. I can use the phone locator on the base of the instrument to locate the phone and when I press the phone locator the phone starts beeping.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Problem: Which area of my home should I search?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Frequentist Reasoning\n",
    "I can hear the phone beeping. I also have a mental model which helps me identify the area from which the sound is coming. Therefore, upon hearing the beep, I infer the area of my home I must search to locate the phone.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Bayesian Reasoning\n",
    "I can hear the phone beeping. Now, apart from a mental model which helps me identify the area from which the sound is coming from, I also know the locations where I have misplaced the phone in the past. So, I combine my inferences using the beeps and my prior information about the locations I have misplaced the phone in the past to identify an area I must search to locate the phone.\n",
