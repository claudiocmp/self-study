    "## Duality\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical optimization theory, duality or the duality principle is the principle that optimization problems may be viewed from either of two perspectives, the primal problem or the dual problem. The solution to the dual problem provides a lower bound to the solution of the primal (minimization) problem.[1] However in general the optimal values of the primal and dual problems need not be equal. Their difference is called the duality gap. For convex optimization problems, the duality gap is zero under a constraint qualification condition.\n",

    "## Combinatorial problems\n",
    "\n",
    "Some common problems involving combinatorial optimization are the travelling salesman problem (\"TSP\") and the minimum spanning tree problem (\"MST\"). \n",

    "A minimum spanning tree of a weighted planar graph. Finding a minimum spanning tree is a common problem involving combinatorial optimization.\n",

    "## Black Box Optimization\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Black Box\" optimization refers to a problem setup in which an optimization algorithm is supposed to optimize (e.g., minimize) an objective function through a so-called black-box interface: the algorithm may query the value f(x) for a point x, but it does not obtain gradient information, and in particular it cannot make any assumptions on the analytic form of f (e.g., being linear or quadratic).\n"
